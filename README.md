<h1>StudyConnect: A Study Group for Learners</h1>
<p>StudyConnect is a collaborative platform designed to bridge the gap between students and educational resources, providing an interactive 
space for learning, collaboration, and academic support. As a team, we developed this website to offer students easy access to study materials, peer-to-peer 
communication tools, and scheduling features for group study sessions. The platform includes functionalities such as subject-specific discussion forums, resource 
sharing, and event calendars to help students stay organized and engaged. Our team focused on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing interface while ensuring 
smooth navigation and efficient interaction with educational content. Through our collective efforts, StudyConnect aims to foster a strong sense of community and enhance 
the learning experience for students by making educational resources more accessible and facilitating effective collaboration.</p>

<p>The website was developed using a combination of technologies to ensure a responsive and user-friendly experience. 
We utilized HTML for structuring the content, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic elements. 
To ensure a modern and mobile-responsive design, we incorporated Bootstrap, which provided a solid foundation for grid layouts and pre-designed components. 
The website includes features like subject-specific forums, resource sharing, and event scheduling, enabling students to collaborate efficiently and stay organized. 
Our team focused on creating a seamless user experience with intuitive navigation, ensuring the platform is both accessible and visually appealing across devices. 
Through this project, we were able to apply our skills in web development while creating a valuable tool for students to enhance their learning.
